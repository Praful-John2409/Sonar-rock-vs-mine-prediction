# Classification Projects

Welcome to the repository for my classification projects! This repository contains two different classification models: Rock or Mine Prediction and Diabetes Prediction. Each project is designed to tackle a unique problem using machine learning techniques.

## Rock vs Mine Prediction

### Overview

The Rock or Mine Prediction project aims to classify whether a given instance is a rock or a mine based on its features. This type of classification problem is often used in mining and geolocation applications to differentiate between safe and hazardous objects.

### Features

- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing the model includes various features that describe the characteristics of rocks and mines.
- **Algorithms**: Various classification algorithms have been implemented, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score are used to evaluate model performance.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Praful-John2409/projects-on-classification.git]
   ```


## Diabetes Prediction

### Overview

The Diabetes Prediction project is focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on various health-related features. This model can be used to identify individuals at risk and potentially assist in early diagnosis and intervention.

### Features

- **Dataset**: The dataset includes medical attributes such as blood pressure, BMI, and glucose levels.
- **Algorithms**: Implemented algorithms include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The performance is evaluated using Accuracy, ROC AUC Score, and Confusion Matrix.

### Getting Started
